1. **Set Up Version Control:**
   - If you haven't already, initialize your project's version control system (e.g., Git). Commit your initial project structure to create a starting point.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure your development environment is set up correctly. Install the required tools and dependencies, including Go, Python, database systems, and development environments for your frontend (e.g., Node.js).

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Start with the frontend development. Building the user interface early allows you to create a visual representation of your app's core features.
   - Develop basic frontend components and pages, focusing on user registration, login, and the dashboard for creating and managing notes.
   - Implement frontend components for the sketching tool and ensure it integrates well with the rest of the UI.

4. **Backend Development (Go):**
   - Begin developing the Go backend. Focus on setting up basic routes, request handling, and database interactions for user authentication and note management.
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Create API endpoints for creating, editing, and deleting notes.
   - Set up routes for real-time collaboration using WebSockets or a similar technology.
   
5. **Database Integration:**
   - Integrate your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with the Go backend. Create database schemas for users, notes, and any other necessary data entities.
   - Implement database operations for storing and retrieving user data and notes.
   
6. **Sketch Enhancement (Python Backend):**
   - Develop the Python backend responsible for sketch enhancement using the Stable Diffusion algorithm.
   - Create an API endpoint for sending sketches to the Python backend for enhancement.
   - Implement the sketch enhancement algorithm in Python.
   
7. **Frontend-Backend Integration:**
   - Establish communication between the frontend and the Go backend using API requests.
   - Implement functionality to create, edit, and retrieve notes from the frontend.
   - Set up real-time collaboration features, ensuring that users can see changes made by collaborators instantly.

8. **User Authentication:**
   - Finalize user authentication features on the backend. Implement token-based authentication or sessions to secure your API endpoints.
   - Ensure that users can securely register, log in, and manage their accounts.

9. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Begin writing unit tests for both the frontend and backend components.
   - Implement integration tests to verify that different parts of your application work together as expected.
   - Set up automated testing as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

10. **Sketch Enhancement Integration:**
    - Connect the frontend to the Python sketch enhancement backend using API requests.
    - Test the end-to-end flow of uploading sketches, enhancing them, and displaying the enhanced sketches in the frontend.

11. **Note Sharing and Collaboration:**
    - Implement the functionality to share notes and sketches with collaborators. Ensure that changes made by one user are reflected in real-time for others.
    - Set up version history tracking for notes and sketches.

12. **Documentation:**
    - As you proceed with development, continually update your project's documentation, including the README, CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and any API documentation.

13. **User Interface Refinement:**
    - Continuously refine and improve the user interface based on user feedback and usability testing.

14. **Deployment and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    - Configure deployment scripts and pipelines for both the frontend and backend.
    - Deploy your application to a staging or production environment.
    - Set up automated deployment as part of your CI/CD process.

15. **User Testing and Feedback:**
    - Involve users or beta testers to provide feedback on the application's usability and functionality.
    - Address issues and bugs identified during user testing.

16. **Finalization and Maintenance:**
    - Perform a final review of your project, ensuring that it meets all requirements and standards.
    - Plan for ongoing maintenance, including updates, security patches, and feature enhancements.

Remember to follow best practices, write clean and well-documented code, and regularly commit your changes to version control. Breaking the development process into manageable steps will help you maintain control over your project and ensure steady progress toward completion.
